# Serverless-Web-Application
Developed a serverless login page with the help of AWS Azure.
Developed the website which helped in getting the location of the particular person.
The website was developed with the help of AWS and was serverless so there is no need to managr the infrastrucutre.
The application still runs on the servers, but the management is done by AWS.
